To-do list
-----------

1. Currently, after the end of each move, we need to reset the staging grid to the base grid.
>> How to organise the different grids? (base grid, staging grid, 2nd staging grid (see point 3))
2. Introduce gravity
3. Introduce collision detection (might require another staging grid)
4. Introduce keyboard entries
5. Check when any line is full and remove it

~~~ At this point, we should have a minimal working tetris game ~~~

6. Add GUI
7. Improve graphics

~~~ At this point, we should have a working single-player tetris game ~~~
